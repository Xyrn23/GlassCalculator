# Glassmorphism Calculator using scode.ai

This project demonstrates how to create a responsive Glassmorphism calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator design features a gradient background, curved lines, and blur effect, giving the calculator a modern and unique appearance.

## Getting Started

To get started, copy the provided `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` code snippets into the respective files in your project directory. Ensure that all three files are in the same directory.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser to run the Glassmorphism calculator, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. No additional tools or dependencies are required.

## Calculator Design

The Glassmorphism calculator is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design consists of the following components:

- Gradient background

- Curved lines (created using SVG)

- Glassmorphism effect with a blur

- Responsive layout using CSS Grid and media queries

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure includes a container for the wavy background, the calculator's container, an input display field, and button elements for calculator functionality.

### CSS Styling

The provided CSS code includes the following styles:

- Glassmorphism effect for the calculator background

- Backdrop filter to create the blur effect

- Gradient background color and curved lines using an SVG path

- Button styling and hover effects

- Responsive layout using CSS Grid and media queries

### JavaScript Functionality

The `script.js` file should contain the logic for the calculator, including handling button clicks, performing calculations, and updating the calculator's display.

## Usage

1. Save the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files in the same directory on your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to see the Glassmorphism calculator in action.

3. Interact with the calculator using the on-screen buttons or your keyboard.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the calculator design to your needs. You can modify the colors or other visual elements by updating the related CSS properties in the `styles.css` file. For additional features or different calculation logic, update the `script.js` file accordingly.
